## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   A Supabase account and a new project.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Supabase project credentials. You can find these in your Supabase project's "Settings" > "API" section.
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```

4.  **Set up the Supabase database:**
    Log in to your Supabase account, navigate to the "SQL Editor", and run the SQL scripts located in the `supabase/` directory of this project. You will also need to run the functions listed in the **Database Functions** section below.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## Database Functions

You must run the following SQL functions in your Supabase SQL Editor for all application features to work correctly.

### `get_revenue_summary_stats` (with Average Order Value)

### `get_total_products_sold_for_store`

### `create_order_with_snapshots`

This function is required for creating new orders from the "Add Order" dialog. It ensures that product and pricing data are captured correctly at the time of sale.

```sql
-- Creates a new order and its associated items with price and cost snapshots.

## Next Steps

After your initial commit, you can continue to develop features. The standard workflow is:
1.  Make changes to your code.
2.  `git add .`
3.  `git commit -m "A descriptive message about your changes"`
4.  `git push origin main`
